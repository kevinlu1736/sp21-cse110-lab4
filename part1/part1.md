## Part 1a  
1. values added:  20
2. final result:  20
3. Error, it should print: values added: 20, but line 13 result is undefine, result is only available in the {}
4. Error, line 13 result is undefine, result is only available in the {}
5. Error, line 7, can't reasign value to const
6. Error, out of scope, const value not accessible out side the block, and lin 7 has error described above.

## Part 1b  
1. log 3 to console, var is visible to the inside of the function
2. log 150 to console, var discountedPrice is accessible from outside the block, it's valid inside the function
3. log 150 to console, finalPrice is accessible it's valid inside the function.
4. an object, a list of discounted prices
5. Error, i is defined by let. It's only available in the for loop
6. Error, discountedPrice is defined by let. It's only available in the for loop
7. log 150 to console, finalPrice defined in the function, it's valid inside the function
8. It returns an object, a list of discounted prices. discounted is defined in the function, it's valid inside the function.
9. Error, i defined by let. It's not available outside the for loop
10. 3, it constains the length of the input (prices), it's visible inside the function
11. object of list of 3, discounted price(not rounded)  
12. Data Types   
A. student.name  
B. student['Grad Year']
C. student.greeting()
D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name
E. student.courseLoad[0]

13. Arithmetic
A. 32, 2 is converted to '2'
B. 1, '3' is converted to number
C. 3, null is converted to 0
D. 3null, null is converted to string
E. 4, true maps to 1
F. 0, false maps to 0, null maps to 0
G. 3undefined, undefined is converted to string
H. NaN, undefined is Nan, it can't convert to a number

14. Comparison
A. true, '2' becomes 2
B. false, strings are compared letter by letter
C. true, '2' becomes 2
D. false, '2' won't be converted
E. false, true maps to 0
F. true, 2 is converted to true

15. '==' will convert the types before comparison, '===' will not

17.  The returned new array contains [2, 4, 6]     
line 13: modifyArray is called with [1,2,3] and doSomething     
line 3: loop through the [1,2,3], call doSomething to each element and push the result into newArr   
line 6: return the new array  
doSomething is a mapping function that map the original value to 2 times of the value   

19.  output:

```
1   
4  
3  
2  
```
